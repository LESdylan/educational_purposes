        <h3 id="overview"> Overview of the Mossi People</h3>
        <p>The Mossi people, also known as the Moose, are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso,
          comprising approximately half of the country's population. They primarily inhabit the central plateau region,
          including the capital city, Ouagadougou.
          The Mossi society is traditionally organized into a hierarchical system with a central authority figure known
          as
          the "Moro Naba" (king), who resides in Ouagadougou.
          This system of chieftaincy has been a unifying force among the Mossi for centuries.</p>

        <h3 id="scope_structure">Scope and Structure</h3>
        <p>Historically, Mossi society was organized into several kingdoms, the most prominent being the Yatenga
          Kingdom,
          Ouagadougou Kingdom, and Tenkodogo Kingdom. Each kingdom was ruled by a king (the Mogho Naba) who wielded
          considerable authority.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Clan Structure: Mossi society is organized into clans (koms) that trace their lineage through patrilineal
          descent. Each clan is led by a chief (nakomse).</p>

          <h3 id="origins">1. Origins of the Mossi</h3>
          <p>Les Mossi sont un peuple d'Afrique de l'Ouest, principalement concentr√© au Burkina Faso. Leur histoire
            remonte
            √† plusieurs royaumes pr√©coloniaux, tels que le royaume de Ouagadougou et le royaume de Yatenga, connus pour
            leur
            organisation politique et sociale avanc√©e. Les Mossi sont reconnus pour leur culture riche et leur
            r√©silience √†
            travers les si√®cles.</p>
          <h3 id="formation">1. Formation of the Mossi Kingdom</h3>
          <p>The formation of the Mossi dates back to the migration of Mand√© ethnic groups into present-day Burkina Faso
            between the 11th and 13th centuries. These migrations led to the establishment of several Mossi kingdoms,
            such
            as Ouagadougou and Yatenga, each ruled by a king (the Mogho Naba). The Mossi developed a structured society
            with
            distinct political and social systems, becoming known for their thriving agriculture and rich culture
            characterized by distinctive artistic and religious traditions.</p>
